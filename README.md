# MainCrafts – Responsive Landing Page

Developed as part of the **Full Stack Web Development Internship – Task 1**, this project is a fully responsive startup-style landing page.  
The objective was to design and develop a modern, visually appealing landing page that represents a startup, product launch, or portfolio homepage using semantic HTML and modern CSS practices.

## Design Approach
